"""
    This class is responsible for the Minimax algorithm.
    At each depth, the algorithm will simulate up to 7 boards, each having a piece that has been dropped in a free column. So with depth 1, we will have 7 boards to analyse, with depth 2 : 49 ,...
    Through a system of reward each board will be attributed a score. The Minimax will then either try to minimise or maximise the rewards depending on the depth (odd or even). Indeed, because we are using multiple 
    depth, the minimax algorithm will simulate in alternance the possible moves of the current player and the ones of the adversary (creating Min nodes and max nodes). The player that needs to decide where to 
    drop a piece on the current board is considered as the maximising player, hence trying to maximise the reward when a max nodes is encountered. The algorithm will also consider that the adversary plays as good as possible (with
    the information available with the depth chosen) and hence try to minimise the reward when possible (minimizing player). 
    So after creating all the boards of the tree, at each depth, a board will be selected based on the reward and on the type of nodes (min or max node) starting from the bottom of the tree.
    The final choice is made based on the 7 boards possible with the score updated through the reward procedure describe above.
    Note that the larger the depth, the slower the execution.
    In order to avoid unnecessary exploration of boards, an alpha beta pruning has been implemented.
